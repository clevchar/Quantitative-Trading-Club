Welcome to the repo of the Quantitative Trading Club @ Loyola

Here are some resources or reccomended problems for members: 

TOPICS OF INTEREST
Market neutral strategies (statistical arbitrage, pairs trading, parity, hedgingâ€¦)
Stochastic processes (Brownian motion, Poisson processes, stochastic volatility, BSM)
Implied Volatility (inversion of BSM, Skew vs 3D, SABR, Bayesian ridge regression)
Least Squares Monte Carlo (account for early exercise, define optimal stopping policy)
Order book imbalance (buy/sell side pressure, order scaling, inverse OBI weighted midprice)
Sentiment analysis (web parsing, LLMs, Sentiment quotients)
Energy correlated trading (sunlight/ weather index impact on crop futures, relative scarcity)
Hedging (delta, gamma, synthetic spreads, deep hedging)
Hidden Markov Models (stochastic matrices, steady states, recursive probability)

Easy projects ideas:
BSM and IV definition
Least Squares Monte Carlo simulation of Brownian Motion (BSM, Heston, Bates) 
Delta Hedging definition and explanation
IEX 1 year historical data pull and plot cointegrated equities at different perspectives (1D,1M,1Y) (alpaca)
Break down exchange by market participant volume

Our repo will be partioned by group projects. Please respect the folder system so we can keep this space organized.
